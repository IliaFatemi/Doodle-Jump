# Doodle-Jump
Doodle jump game made in python.
This program is built using the turtle module.  


CONTROLS
---------------------

To go left click the "LEFT" button or hold to go faster in the given direction.

To go right click the "RIGHT" button or hold to go faster in the given direction.


TIPS
---------------------

The longer you hold a button, the more speed you will gain. To slow the character down, 
you must hold or press in the opposite direction.

The doodle character is very sensitive when contacted by any platform, sometime s
the character may seem too far to reach a certain platform. If you get close enough by a touch, the character
will grab on and climb up the platform.

Be careful not to hit the bottom of some platforms. This will cause the character to bounce in the opposite direction.


PLATFORM TYPES
----------------------

Green platform ----> These platforms are the most common that you will see. They're purpose is to give the 
		     player a better chance at jumping onto the next platform in sight.


Blue platform -----> These platforms will be bouncing back and forth across the screen 
		     and will always be moving. It can get difficult for the player to hold balance.


Brown platform ----> These platforms are to trick the player into a Trap. 
		     Once contacted with one, the platform will break and the player will fall down.
